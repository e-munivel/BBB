WebConf

WebConf is an open source web conferencing system based on BBB.  

WebConf supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard controls), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboard, and breakout rooms.  

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed WebConf for online learning.  The educational use cases for BBB are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)
