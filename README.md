BBB
===
BBB is an open source web conferencing system.  

BBB supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard controls), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboard, and breakout rooms.  

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed BBB for online learning, (though it can be used for many [other applications](https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2015/02/11/disa-to-replace-dco-with-new-collaboration-services-tool/) as well).  The educational use cases for BBB are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)

You can install on a Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit server. We provide [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) to let you have a server up and running within 30 minutes (or your money back ðŸ˜‰).
